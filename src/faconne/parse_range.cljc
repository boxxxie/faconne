  You might think the volatile ref is extraneous since we're using transients, but
  fns like `conj!` are meant to be used for the result they return, not for their side-effects.

  If the range is a map, then the result is a persistent
  map. Initially, I had created functions like assoc-in! and
  update-in! that worked on nested map transients, but found that
  these were actually slower than just merging a bunch of small
